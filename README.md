# TM-Based IoT Bitstream Log Validator (UART 8E1)

Console-based Theory of Automata project that demonstrates a **Turing Machine (TM) simulator** validating and annotating an IoT-style serial capture log by performing explicit **read / write / move** transitions on a tape.

This implementation focuses on validating UART-like **8E1** frames (start bit, 8 data bits, even parity, 1 stop bit) from a raw bitstream and marking each frame as OK/ERROR directly on the tape output. [web:170]

## Repository contents

- `main.py`  
  Main program + TM engine + UART 8E1 validation TM.

- `iot_capture.log`  
  Dummy captured log input (timestamp, device metadata, and `raw=` bitstream).

- `validated_output.log`  
  Example output report generated by the program after validation.

- `report/` (planned)  
  Will contain:
  - Overleaf source (`.tex`, `.bib`, etc.)
  - Final exported PDF

## Quick start 

1. Clone the repo:
2. Delete `validated_output.log` (You will generate it by running `main.py` file)
